🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)


📌 Overview
This project implements a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Utilizing Python and essential libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, the model is trained to accurately classify digits ranging from 0 to 9.

🔧 Features
Custom ANN Implementation: Built from scratch without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks.

MNIST Dataset: Employs the standard MNIST dataset comprising 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Training and Evaluation: Includes functionalities for model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/AyushPrakash414/DigitRecognitionUsingNeuralNetwork.git
cd DigitRecognitionUsingNeuralNetwork
Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install numpy matplotlib
Run the Notebook

Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook digit_recognistion_using_Neural_network.ipynb
Follow the notebook cells to train and evaluate the model.

📊 Results
After training, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately 92% on the test dataset. Below is a sample visualization of the model's predictions:


Note: Replace the above image URL with an actual output image from your model.

🧪 Testing the Model
To test the trained model on new data:

Ensure the model is trained and the weights are saved.

Run the check.py script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python check.py
This script will load the trained model and prompt you to input a digit image for prediction.
